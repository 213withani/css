* Create rows using HTML div element and if columns are needed, nested them inside the divs
ex: 
```
html
 div 
  h1 
 div
  div # nav
  div # main
 div
  footer
html
```

* commas are used to shared properties between elements.
* spaces are used to be more specific. You can drill down inside nested elements, thus a long chain separated by spaces can be createda.
